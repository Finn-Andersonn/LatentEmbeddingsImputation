# IMPORTANCE: Not as relevant. But is a nice-to-have I think. 
# If causality results are significant, they can strengthen the narrative (e.g., “EIA reporting drives imaging, justifying our use of EIA dates as a feature”)
#
# Transfer entropy or regression view of proving Granger Causality
#   -> This is likely more relevant as we need to prove the EIA reporting causes image acquisition
#   -> Run lightweight Granger causality test between EIA reporting dates and imaging_time
#
# 'Through observations, one can only estimate the likelihood of the occurence of an event.'
