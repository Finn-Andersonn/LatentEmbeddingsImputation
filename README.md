Multivariate time series imputation remains a pivotal problem in advanced data analysis. Time series data is ubiquitous, stretching across healthcare, finance, meteorology, and, in this paper, oil tank data. However, recordings are not always complete: instrument malfunctions, data corruption, communication failures, weather restrictions, or even regulatory changes produce missing values. One widespread solution to this issue is imputation: the process of replacing missing points in a dataset based on observed values. In this paper, I implement a Latent Embedding Contrastive Learning model to solve this problem, using a Louisiana Tank Farm Dataset as a case study.
